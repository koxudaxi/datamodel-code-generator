# Contributing

Hello!

I you'd like to contribute to this project, you are welcome to do so.

## Get started

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to manage our dependencies and [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to run checks before committing.

You can head over to their project homepage to install them.

Once that is done, you can install the stack with the following commands

```bash
poetry install
pre-commit install
```

Happy contributing!
