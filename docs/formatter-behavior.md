# Formatter behavior

`datamodel-codegen` formats generated Python code after model generation. The default formatter list is currently `black` and `isort`.

This default will change in a future release. The default formatter will become `builtin`, and external formatter
dependencies will become opt-in so that generated output can be produced without installing formatter packages.

## Formatter selection

Use `--formatters` to select the formatter pipeline.

```bash
datamodel-codegen \
    --input schema.yaml \
    --output model.py \
    --formatters builtin
```

Available formatter names are:

| Name | Behavior |
| ---- | -------- |
| `builtin` | Internal formatter for generated model modules. No external package is required. |
| `black` | Runs Black against generated code. |
| `isort` | Runs isort against generated imports. |
| `ruff-check` | Runs `ruff check --fix`. |
| `ruff-format` | Runs `ruff format`. |

`--formatters` selects which formatter integrations are enabled. It does not reorder the built-in integrations:
single-file output is processed as isort, built-in formatter, Black, then Ruff check/format when those formatters are
selected.
The built-in formatter is an alternative to external formatting, not a pre-formatter.
If `builtin` is passed together with `black`, `isort`, `ruff-check`, or `ruff-format`, `builtin` is ignored.

### ⚡ Speed up generation

The default formatter list is currently `black` and `isort`. For faster generation with no extra formatter dependency,
prefer `--formatters builtin` for standard generated model modules. In a future version, the default formatter will
change to `builtin` and the Black/isort dependencies will become opt-in.

If you prefer Ruff, install it with `pip install 'datamodel-code-generator[ruff]'` and use
`--formatters ruff-check ruff-format` for a fast external formatter.

Custom templates can emit Python outside the standard generated model patterns covered by `builtin`, so
custom-template output is not exhaustively validated. If `--formatters builtin` produces invalid or poorly formatted
output with a custom template, please open an issue with a small reproducer.

## Built-in formatter scope

The built-in formatter is intentionally small. It is not a general Python formatter and is not expected to produce byte-for-byte identical output to the latest Black, isort, or Ruff for arbitrary Python files.

It covers the generated-code patterns that matter for model modules:

- Removes trailing whitespace and writes a final newline.
- Parses the module with `ast`.
- Sorts only the leading import block. It stops at the first non-import statement.
- Splits `import a, b` into separate `import` lines.
- Groups imports in this order: `__future__`, standard library, third-party, relative imports.
- Sorts `from ... import ...` names and merges imports from the same module.
- Wraps long `from ... import ...` statements with parentheses when they exceed the configured line length.
- Leaves commented import lines in place instead of dropping comments while sorting imports.
- Sorts imports inside a top-level `if TYPE_CHECKING:` block when that block contains only imports.
- Keeps two blank lines before a top-level `class`, `def`, or `async def` after the import block.
- Wraps generated model statements for common long `Field(...)`, `Annotated[...]`, and `ConfigDict(...)` lines.
- Normalizes simple generated string quotes to double quotes when `--use-double-quotes` is passed or `[tool.black].skip-string-normalization = false`.

If the generated code cannot be parsed as Python, the built-in formatter only applies whitespace cleanup and returns the code.

The built-in formatter does not currently format:

- General expressions inside classes or functions.
- List, dict, tuple, or arbitrary call argument layout outside the generated model patterns listed above.
- General quote style rewrites outside simple generated strings.
- String wrapping outside supported generated call arguments.
- Comment placement beyond preserving commented import lines.
- Import section rules beyond the simple groups listed above.

This scope matters when using `--custom-template-dir`. Custom templates can emit arbitrary Python code outside the
generated model patterns listed above, so custom-template output is not exhaustively validated with the built-in
formatter. If `--formatters builtin` produces invalid or poorly formatted output with a custom template, please open an
issue with a small reproducer.

For exact Black, isort, or Ruff behavior, continue to pass those formatters explicitly.
The built-in formatter is not run before external formatters.

## Line length

The built-in formatter uses line length for wrapping `from ... import ...` statements and the generated model
statements listed above.

Set it in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.datamodel-codegen]
formatters = ["builtin"]
builtin-format-line-length = 100
```

When `builtin-format-line-length` is not set, the built-in formatter reuses existing formatter configuration in this order:

1. `[tool.ruff].line-length`
2. `[tool.black].line-length`
3. `[tool.isort].line_length`
4. `88`

This fallback only reads configuration values. It does not require Ruff, Black, or isort to be installed.

An explicit API value always wins over `pyproject.toml`.

## String normalization

The built-in formatter keeps single quotes by default. It normalizes simple generated string literals to double quotes when either condition is true:

1. `--use-double-quotes` is passed.
2. `[tool.black].skip-string-normalization = false` is set in `pyproject.toml`.

The built-in formatter only reads this Black setting when `builtin` is selected without an external formatter.

## API usage

Library users can pass the same setting through `generate()` or `GenerateConfig`.

```python
from pathlib import Path

from datamodel_code_generator import generate
from datamodel_code_generator.format import Formatter

generate(
    input_=Path("schema.yaml"),
    output=Path("model.py"),
    formatters=[Formatter.BUILTIN],
    builtin_format_line_length=100,
)
```

## Migration notes

To keep current output behavior, set the external formatters explicitly:

```bash
datamodel-codegen \
    --input schema.yaml \
    --output model.py \
    --formatters black isort
```

To test the dependency-free path, use:

```bash
datamodel-codegen \
    --input schema.yaml \
    --output model.py \
    --formatters builtin
```

Generated output may differ from Black or isort output in places outside the built-in formatter scope. Treat those differences as expected unless they change Python semantics or produce invalid code.
