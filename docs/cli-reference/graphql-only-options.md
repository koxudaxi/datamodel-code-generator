## `--graphql-no-typename` {#graphql-no-typename}

Exclude __typename field from generated GraphQL models.

The `--graphql-no-typename` flag prevents the generator from adding the
`typename__` field (aliased to `__typename`) to generated models. This is
useful when using generated models for GraphQL mutations, as servers typically
don't expect this field in input data.

!!! tip "Usage"

    ```bash
    datamodel-codegen --input schema.json --graphql-no-typename # (1)!
    ```

    1. :material-arrow-left: `--graphql-no-typename` - the option documented here

??? example "Examples"

    **Input Schema:**

    ```graphql
    type Book {
      id: ID!
      title: String
    }
    
    interface Node {
      id: ID!
    }
    
    input BookInput {
      title: String!
    }
    ```

    **Output:**

    ```python
    # generated by datamodel-codegen:
    #   filename:  no-typename.graphql
    #   timestamp: 2019-07-26T00:00:00+00:00

    The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache.

    The `String` scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.
