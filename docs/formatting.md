# Formatting

Code generated by `datamodel-codegen` will be passed through `isort` and
`black` to produce consistent, well-formatted results. Settings for these tools
can be specified in `pyproject.toml` (located in the output directory, or in
some parent of the output directory). Also for black you can disable 
skip-string-normalization with using datamodel-codegen option `--use-double-quotes`, 
it will override your black config skip-string-normalization value.
Using --use-double-quotes may be useful if you can't use black config. 

## Example

**pyproject.toml**
```toml
[tool.black]
skip-string-normalization = true
line-length = 100

[tool.isort]
multi_line_output = 3
include_trailing_comma = true
force_grid_wrap = 0
use_parentheses = true
line_length = 100
known_first_party = "kelvin"
```

See the [Black Project](https://pypi.org/project/black/) for more information.
