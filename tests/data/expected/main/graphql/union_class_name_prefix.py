The `Boolean` scalar type represents `true` or `false`.

FooID = TypeAliasType("FooID", str)
"""
The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as `"4"`) or integer (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.
"""


FooInt = TypeAliasType("FooInt", int)
"""
The `Int` scalar type represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values. Int can represent values between -(2^31) and 2^31 - 1.
"""


FooString = TypeAliasType("FooString", str)
"""
The `String` scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.
