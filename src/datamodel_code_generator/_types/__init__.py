"""Generated TypedDict types for configuration models.

This module contains TypedDict classes auto-generated from the Config Pydantic models
using datamodel-codegen itself (dogfooding). These types enable type-safe **kwargs
patterns with Unpack[].

The TypedDict files in this directory are generated by running:
    tox -e config-types

Do not edit the generated files manually.
